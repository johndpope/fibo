    <h2>Will return the prediction of the neural network</h2>
    <h3>Explanation</h3>    
    <p>
        We trained a small and simple neural network on triplets of the fibonacci sequence. <br>
        The network was trained to predict the third number based on the first two numbers. <br>
        Based on this information, the network approximates 'addition'. <br>
        This is because each numbers in the fibonacci sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. <br>
        Due to the nature of the fibonacci sequence, which only contains positive numbers, <br>
        the model only handles positive numbers. It has never seen a negative number, so it <br>
        avoids predicting it. <br>
